# QFJ-Machine
 QFJ stands for Quote, Facts and Jokes

## Build with React JS, Axios, Express and Node JS
The QFJ-Machine is a webapp and generates quotes, facts and also jokes from three different APIS. QFJ stands for "Quotes", "Facts" and "Jokes".

For the frontend I used the useState-hook to get the data from my backend and I also added a component folder with the React JS components in it.

I created the backend with the help of Express and Node JS. The reason why I created also a backend was, to hide my API-Keys properly.
